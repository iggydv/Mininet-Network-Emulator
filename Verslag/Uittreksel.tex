%*** THE ABSTRACT PAGE ************************************

\begin{abstract}
    The aim of this project is to develop a tool with which one can build a virtual network topology, and simulate the
    Network's performance by using various user defined network parameters, without having to physically set up the nwtwork.
    The project was broken up into two main components namely: (1) a completely vitual network and (2) a Semi-virtual network\\\\
 \textbf{\textit{Case 1: Fully-Virtual Network}}\\\\
     In the completely virtual case, all components are simulated and a simulated network is used to emulate the performance
     of the network topology through various standard mininet tests.\\\\
 \textbf{\textit{Case 2: Semi-Virtual Network}}\\\\
    In the semi-virtual case, all components are real hardware components (Hosts and Switches) and a simulated network is used to
    emulate the performance of the network topology through various standard mininet tests.\\\\
    Furthermore Various test Situations were created to test both Cases 1 and 2, to ensure that both of  cases function\\
    Identically under certain network conditions
